# Javascript
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that is primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on web pages. Initially developed by Netscape in 1995 as a simple scripting language, JavaScript has since evolved into one of the core technologies of web development, alongside HTML and CSS.
